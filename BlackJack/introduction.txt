    * Welcome to the world's best Black Jack game  *
    *************************************************
    The objective of the game is to have a hand with a total 
    value higher than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.
    basic rules of the game:
    Card Values
        Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.
        Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
        An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points.
    Dealing Cards:
        The dealer deals two cards to player, including themselves. 
        However, one of the dealer's cards is face-up
        while the other is face-down (hidden).
    Player Options:
        Hit: Request an additional card from the dealer.
        Stand: Keep the current hand without taking any more cards.
    Objective:
        The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. 
        Going over 21 results in an automatic loss, regardless of the dealer's hand.
    Dealer's Turn:
        After the player have made his decision, 
        the dealer reveals their face-down card. 
        The dealer must hit (take another card) until their hand totals 17 or higher.
